When I looked out my window, I was surprised to see that the once green ground was now completely
covered by a fluffy white substance. I jumped out of my bed, put on clothes, hopped into my shoes,
and scurried outside. The scenery was beautiful; little white puffballs were still falling from
the sky. I ran around, caught a few on my tongue, and proceeded to frolick in the cold, white powder.
My soul was at ease - a most wonderful feeling.
