	<H1>Distant World Lyrics</H1><BR>

<center>

Since the first day I met you,<BR>
You've been always on my mind.<BR>
I've always wanted to tell you,<BR>
I can't leave you behind.<BR><BR>

There's another world for me,<BR>
a distant world so far away,<BR>
a place where I belong,<BR>
I'll go there someday.<BR><BR>

Leave your worries all behind,<BR>
there's no reason to believe,<BR>
that there is nowhere left for you now,<BR>
come with me and you will see.<BR><BR>

That there's another world for us,<BR>
a distant world so far away,<BR>
a place where we belong,<BR>
we'll go there today.<BR><BR>

In my dreams, I see a place,<BR>
a place where I lie with you.<BR>
At night, the stars all shine brightly,<BR>
then twilight comes, the day anew.<BR><BR>

But right now, my dream's so far away,<BR>
I don't know just what I should say,<BR>
there's nothing left to hide.<BR>
Of all the things that I live for,<BR>
you're the one I truly need,<BR>
I want you by my side.<BR><BR>

Since the first day I met you,<BR>
(oh, since the first)<BR>
you've been always on my mind,<BR>
(every day)<BR>
but it seems so hopeless,<BR>
(you'll never love me)<BR>
I guess I'll just leave you behind.<BR>
(what else can I do?)<BR>
