<h2>In Case Anyone's Been Wondering...</h2>

I apologize for the complete and utter lack of updates in the past year and a half or so.  I've been busy with life, and got myself a neat engineering job at
a cool little company in Austin at which I've been working for the past ten months.  Since it does take up most of my day, I haven't been devoting the usual
amount of focus on my creative hobbies.  But fear not, I have anything but given up on my most important creative outlets.  I've got music
in the works that I'm planning to complete, and I'm still collaborating with my friend on making iPhone apps and games at
<a href="http://www.pnrstudios.com" target="_blank">PNR Studios</a>.  As soon as I've got something to show, whether it be a collection of songs or a neat little iPhone game (more likely),
I'll be updating again.  Stay tuned!<BR><BR>

<h2>Music in the Works</h2>

I've been working on some new (original) songs for the past month or two.  During this time I've decided that I would keep
everything in WIP status until I've created a decent number of songs that I can put together as a cohesive piece of work. This will definitely take a
couple of months, especially when I have school and job hunting to take care of, as well as parties to attend. I'll eventually release a demo or
stand alone song when I think it's appropriate.

<h2>Old site</h2>

I was digging through some files from an old computer that I found sitting in a closet, looking to see if there was anything still useful or nostalgic that I
could salvage. There was a copy of <a href="2005/index.html">this website from early 2005</a>, back when I was still a senior in high school. Looking through
it, I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I wrote some of those blog posts. I'm making it viewable for a little while, because as bad as my writing was, and as ugly as it is,
it <i>was</i> online at one point, and looking at it again now should help to exemplify all the changes and additions I've made over these short four years.<BR><BR>

Yeah, I know I've been asked to update my site, and I know this post is a pretty lame way to do it. I'm trying to create some new content (music with Renoise), and I'm not
really planning to post anything until I make some quality stuff.

<h2>Renoise</h2>

I've been playing around with <a href="http://www.renoise.com" target="_blank">Renoise</a> lately, and I must say I like it a lot more than
<a href="http://www.madtracker.org" target="_blank">Madtracker</a>. The problem with Madtracker is that it hasn't been updated in over three years.
Meanwhile, Renoise is updated constantly, and has many more features and capabilities, and is a contemporary digital audio workstation. I'm
not sure how it compares to more expensive DAWs such as FL Studio and Reason, but for what I want to do with it, it seems more than worth the money.
I'll be starting fresh as far as music making goes and will be switching over to Renoise.<BR><BR>

I've already put together a couple of <a href="misc.html#aeromusic">songs</a> with Renoise for the game my friend and I are planning to make. Feedback please!

<h2>Paintings</h2>

I took a painting class this semester, and I've finally been able to post photos of my paintings.

<h2>End of Semester Anecdotes</h2>

This semester is over, and I only have one left before I get to leave Cleveland and never look back. I'm going to write a couple of short anecdotes from
this semester. You may or may not find them as amusing as I did, but I don't really care.<BR><BR><BR>

	<h3>Senior Project</h3>

For about the first month and a half during my co-op, I was tasked with creating and testing a couple of proof-of-concept heat exchangers. This
turned out to be the perfect project to use for my senior project capstone. Due to the nature of the methodology, I wasn't
required to do any heavy theoretical calculations. If you've ever taken a Thermo and Fluids class, you'd understand how messy
the equations associated with heat exchangers can get. During my final presentation, I presented the efficiencies that I got out of the heat exchangers based on the data.
My professor/advisor then asked me if I had done the 1/1-NTU calculations that he taught to us in Thermo II a few years ago.
I immediately thought to myself, "oh shit, I have no fucking idea what that even means," but replied,
"No, but I'll definitely include that in the paper".<BR><BR>

I didn't really get a chance to start on the final report until the day before it was due, since I had two
very important finals that I desperately needed to study for. I sat down in front of my computer and pretty much wrote the entire twenty
page monster in one day. As I approached the end of the Discussions section, I decided it was time to include the NTU equation that my professor had requested.
I checked Wikipedia and other sources for more information as to how to do it, and what exactly it meant, and only managed to find out that NTU
stood for "Number of Transfer Units" as well as a few convoluted equations that eventually lead up to NTU = UA/Cmin. I plugged and chugged my numbers and came up with
a small decimal that I had no idea know what to do with. I was running short on time to turn this sucker in, so I just left it there without any real explanation for its
meaning. I finished up the Conclusions section, and emailed the report to my professor, hoping he wouldn't read it too carefully, as he had many of these
to grade in just a few short days.<BR><BR>

So I got a reply e-mail from my advisor today. He told me that I did an overall good job, and then went on to address only ONE part of my paper. Guess
what it was?<BR>

<blockquote>"The part that I requested on effectiveness for a counter flow heat exchanger with cmin/cmax = 1,  is e = NTU/(1 + NTU),  not = 1/(1 â€“ NTU).
I changed that part and followed through with the numbers in your report..."</blockquote>

So I used the wrong equation. That's all he had to say. I'm just relieved that he didn't call me out for half-assing and leaving that part of the paper
up to the reader's imagination. The rest of the report was decent, so perhaps he decided to give me a break.<BR><BR><BR>


	<h3>Painting</h3>

I finally decided to take a Painting class this semester, which though I thoroughly enjoyed, I barely managed to ever get there on time since it was
a three hour long class that started at 9:30 AM on Monday and Wednesday. On the Monday after Spring Break, I stumbled into class half awake, having had
less than five hours of sleep. The professor handed out a short pamphlet about Andy Warhol as a background prep for our pop art project. I read through it,
brushed it aside, and laid my head down on the desk while waiting for further instructions. Unexpectedly, the professor asked us to pull out a sheet of paper,
meaning he was giving us a pop quiz. Needless to mention, I did fairly poorly. A few days passed by when my professor addressed me one day out of the blue:<BR><BR>

<b>Professor:</b> Kevin, where were you born?<BR>
<b>Me:</b> China<br>
<b>Professor:</b> When did you move to the US?<BR>
<b>Me:</b> When I was four, why?<br>
<b>Professor:</b> Well you did rather poorly on this quiz, I was wondering if I've been reading you wrong all this time.<BR>
<b>Me:</b> Ohh... hah, yeah. I was half-awake when I took that quiz. The truth is actually more embarrassing.<BR><BR>

The best part about the class was the absence and late policy. Although the professor reminded us many times that class starts at 9:30 sharp, and
the syllabus stated that more than three absences would result in a letter grade reduction of our final grade, I ended up sleeping in a good five times,
and was usually 10-20 minutes late to class. I wasn't the only one, as other students were often late and absent a good number of
times as well. Although I started to worry about my grade after my third skip, I had a feeling that he was too lively and good natured to really punish us
for being tardy or absent, especially if we did well on our paintings. I must've been right, because I ended up with an A.<BR><BR><BR>


	<h3>Vibrations</h3>
	
I took arguably the hardest tech elective I could have chosen: Vibrations. One of my friends was signed up for this class, and told me how it was
important to understand this material as a mechanical engineer. At the last minute, I decided to sign up. The class is listed as two different classes:
387 and 487, 387 being the undergraduate version of 487, a graduate level class. The thing is, there is only one Vibrations class. That is, 387 and 487
are the same class, taught by the same professor, assigned the same homework, and given the same exams. I figured it wouldn't be too bad, but after
the first set of homeworks and exam 1, I realized what a mistake it was.<BR><BR>

After Spring Break, everything went to hell. I got caught up with other classes, and was extremely frustrated with the seemingly impossible Vibrations
homework that kept piling up. I kept telling myself that I would finish the homework, even as each due date passed by. Eventually, I had four
homeworks that I hadn't turned in, the last of which was already two weeks late. At that point in time, we had had eight homeworks total. I panicked over
having four zeros and ruining my grade, so I e-mailed my professor and asked if, despite the solutions having already been posted, I could turn in <i>something</i>
and get some credit as opposed to nothing at all. He allowed me to turn in all four for half credit. Unfortunately, my lack of understanding of the material really showed
on the second exam. At this point, a C looked like a desirable grade.<BR><BR>

In preparation for the final, the professor gave us a previous final for homework. After posting the solutions to that homework, my friend and I learned how to
do every single one of the problems. On final exam day, I was delighted to find that six out of the eight problems on the exam were more or less exactly like the
practice exam. I managed to score a 62/80 on the final, which was a bit lower than I had hoped for, and figured that a solid C would be easily obtained.<BR><BR>

I received a <b>B</b> in that class. No one could have seen that coming. I bet even the professor was thinking to himself as he was turning in grades,
"what the fuck, I'm giving this guy a B? I must be out of my mind."

<h2>PNR Studios</h2>

Okay, so <a href="http://www.mattwanninger.com" target="_blank">Matt</a> and I got busy last summer (school, work, etc) and never finished our
jet shoot-em-up. We were also planning to make it a little too ambitious for a first project.  Once we're done with this semester, however, we'll get back 
to work on a simpler shoot-em-up as a first game. I've updated this site with a Games section to anticipate
the release of one soon. You can also hit up the <a href="http://www.pnrstudios.com">PNR Studios website</a> for more details and updates.

<h2>Dingoo A-320</h2>

I discovered this cool little Chinese knock-off device, the Dingoo A-320, about two weeks ago. Essentially it's a portal media player (PMP) that has the ability to emulate older consoles,
such as the NES and SNES. It's a complete rip off of the Nintendo DS design, and has a GUI that rips off the PSP. Here are a few key specs and features:<BR><BR>


<img src="http://www.gemeitech.com/cn/admin/editnews/UploadFile/200894155736741.jpg" align="right" width="300">

- 2.8 inch screen with a 320 x 240 resolution<BR>
- 400 mhz ARM processor<BR>
- 32 megs of RAM<BR>
- 4 gigs of built-in flash memory, miniSD slot<BR>
- pre-installed NES, SNES, Genesis, GBA, Neo Geo,<BR>
&nbsp; CPS1, and CPS2 emulators<BR>
- Plays music (MP3, FLAC, etc) and videos (MP4, AVI, etc)<br>
- AV out for connecting it to a TV<br>
- The firmware and emulators can be updated<br>
- The SDK is available (homebrew software!)

<BR clear=all><BR>

From everything I've read, the NES and GBA emulation are more or less flawless, but the SNES emulation is a little bit slow, albeit playable. Overall
it's supposed to be worth the money. There are several community sites up and running already, so you can rest assured that you'll have somewhere to go
to in case you run into problems or want new software. I'll post up a review when I get mine later this week or so. If you're interested at all, you can find them at DealExtreme for about 83 bucks.
FYI, a black version is available as of yesterday.

For lack of better things to mention, if you haven't seen Watchmen yet, go see it.<BR><BR>

I just found this <a href="http://kevinc.50megs.com/home.html" target="_blank">little gem</a> from 2000. It's the very first iteration of this website that I made
back when I was in 7th grade. I would just delete the whole thing, but I forgot the account password, so it's going to be there forever, or at
least until 50megs decides to deletes it or goes down. There's a lot of crap, very little artwork, and the music are just midis that
other people made (I didn't even imagine I'd ever get into music creation back then).<BR><BR>

Also, I've added two new things to the music section. The first is a super short little remix of <i>Star Stealing Girl</i> from Chrono Cross / Radical Dreamers. The second is an updated version of <i>Glow</i>, a cover of a Blackfield song.



	<BR><BR><H1>February 1, 2009</h1>

I've been a bum about updating this site for the past few months. Classes have started again, and I've actually got a bit more free time
now than I did when I was working full time, so I'm planning to make some new music soon.  Stay tuned.

<h3>Holy Updates, Batman!</h3>

Three years ago when I discovered that Christian Bale was going to be playing Batman in a darker, more realistically
imagined Batman movie, it was immediately placed on the top of my list of movies to see. Since the
conclusion of <i>Batman Begins</i>, I've been greatly anticipating the sequel and had set my expectations
moderately high. Upon discovering both the new title and the cast, my expectations only continued to climb.<BR><BR>

I saw <i>The Dark Knight</i> yesterday, and despite all the hype and anticipation I had created for myself,
the movie was so good that it took my gargantuan monster of an expectation and made it seem like a harmless little furry animal
in comparison. To keep things short, if you haven't seen it yet, please do so whether or not you're a Batman fan. It will change
your entire perception of the character.

<h2>Back</h2>

I started my co-op a little over three weeks ago, and since I moved into a new apartment,
I haven't had internet until today. For my return, I've added a
<a href="music/remixes/windsofchange.mp3">new song</a> to the music section. It's
a little arrangement that I started over a year ago of a lovely song from Final Fantasy III  as
a way to teach myself how to make sequenced synth piano and drums sound more realistic.
You be the judge of how successful I was.<BR><BR>

<h2>Done, Done, and Done.</h2>

On the morning of our final presentations, our Computer-aided Machining instructor had this to say to us:<BR><BR>

Instructor: "So, everyone knows they have their guaranteed B at this point."

<B>Instructor:</B> Our first mid term will be next Monday<BR>
<B>Me:</B> Oh shit!<BR>

<h2>Foxit Reader</h2>

I thought I'd take the time to mention a terrific freeware program that I use to view PDF files. It's called
<a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php" target="_blank">Foxit Reader</a>, and it's much more stable
and runs faster than Adobe's own Acrobat Reader. It's also completely free. If you're not convinced, just go
try it out for yourself. In fact I told my friend to give it a try, and he later presented me with a question:
"if there's a program that's infinitely better than another program that does the exact same thing, why doesn't
everyone use the better program?" I'm sure you can figure out what he was referring to. Five stars, do it.

<h3>Machining Lab</h3>

On the last day of my mechanical manufacturing machining lab, I had to design and make a simple bookend.
I whipped up a design based on the first thing that came into my mind, since I had little time left to do the actual
machining, and etched it onto the metal, making sure the dimensions were such that the pieces would fit together
decently. It's a really simple design. Here are some pictures to save me from describing it with words:<BR><BR>

<img src="../photos/bookend/bookend1.jpg" class="border" align="left">
<img src="../photos/bookend/bookend2.jpg" class="border" align="right"><BR clear=all><BR>

The whole thing was rushed since we were running out of class time, and it didn't come together perfectly. One sharp tip
stuck out too obnoxiously for my liking, so I promptly asked my instructor if I could quickly grind it down. 
He took my bookend, looked at it and remarked, <i>"man... this thing is wicked. You could put a handle on it here..."</i>
He points to the small crevice, and then makes a stabbing motion. That's my amazing instructor (he's not a professor, and
doesn't like to be called one), the same one who e-mailed me with the <a href="#overrides">"No overrides allowed"</a>
response last semester when I attempted to get into his class a week late.

<h3>Thanksgiving Adventures</h3>

During Thanksgiving break, I flew to Philadelphia to visit my best friend <a href="http://givlmrak.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Rob</a>,
who's currently attending the University of Pennsylvania. I got to meet a couple of his friends and we all hung out, walked around town,
and ate a lot of food. Of course, I had a Philly cheese steak. Afterall, no visit to Philadelphia is complete without having had
a cheese steak, even if it's just bread, beef, and (often) cheese wiz.

<BR><BR>
On Friday, some of Rob's crazy ex-colleagues from New Jersey came to visit us.
The plan was to go to a pool hall in Philly, but as we passed the place, it turned out to be closed.
The guys assured us that there was another pool hall up ahead as we continued driving. The next thing you know, we're on the bridge
passing over the Delaware River heading into New Jersey. When Rob realized this, his ex-roommate Pete quickly turned around
and took a picture of Rob's facial expression with his camera phone, and we all laughed. We drove around in New Jersey
(a place I thought I'd never return to), and eventually crashed at Pete's place.

<BR><BR>
The flight I took back to Cleveland was the sketchiest flight I'd ever been on. When I got to the airport, I couldn't find my flight
listed on any of the departure screens. After getting fed up with searching, I went to the help desk and asked the lady what my
flight gate should be. She couldn't find it in her database at all and told me to go ask Ticketing, which meant I would have to walk
back to the other side of the security area, get my gate information, and go back through security a second time.<BR><BR>

When I finally found my gate and boarded the plane, I thought it would be smooth sailing from then on, but I was wrong. We get
to the runway and we're in the process of taking off when the plane unexpectedly decelerates and makes a right off of the runway.
The captain comes on and basically explains that one of the five power generators failed and that they were going to get it replaced.
Good thing we didn't take off!

<h3>Comments</h3>

I've discovered a free service, <a href="http://www.haloscan.com" target="_blank">Haloscan</a>
that allows me to allow you to comment on my anecdotes, ramblings, rants, reviews, and other
written monstrosities that I post on this site. Enjoy, but don't have too much fun with it,
please.<BR><BR>

Note to self and whomever else it may concern: Do not go jogging at 12 o'clock
AM when it's ~40 degrees, the wind is *always* blowing in your direction, and it's beginning
to lightly drizzle and snow. No matter how much you want to get in shape / hate yourself.

<h3>Pennies</h3>

If you ever find yourself with an ever-growing stash of pennies and you don't know
what to do with them, here's a suggestion. The next time you need just a single
stamp (41 cents, currently), pay for it with all pennies. Forty-one pennies is fairly
reasonable and not a complete chore to count. You might even entertain someone -
when I did this this morning, the person behind the counter got a laugh and said to me,
"man, this is <i>so college</i>!"

<h3>Interesting Article</h3>

<a href="http://www.demonbaby.com/blog/2007/10/when-pigs-fly-death-of-oink-birth-of.html" target="_blank">When Pigs Fly: The Death of Oink,
the Birth of Dissent, and a Brief History of Record Industry Suicide.</a><BR>
This is a fairly decent article, written by Rob Sheridan, the art director for Nine Inch Nails. It's rather lengthy,
but it's definitely worth a read.

<h3>New Remix</h3>

<a href="../../music/remixes/syntheticlove.mp3">Synthetic Love</a> - I'm not sure if this is final yet; for now, this
will do, but I might update it in the near future.<BR><BR>

I've also added an updated version of Distant World to the Music section (the song's new content might surprise you).
I've also added two new drawings to the Artwork section (I haven't added anything new to that
section in years).<BR><BR>

Enjoy!

<h3>First Liquid Obsession Review</h3>

I'm going to do something different today. I'm going to write a review of a product because I'm bored and lame like that.<BR><BR>

Yesterday, my friend and I went grocery shopping. I decided to buy a large pack of bottled water, so we went to that isle.
As I glanced at the different waters, one particular brand caught my eye. The brand is called "FLO", which stands for
"First Liquid Obsession", and is labeled as a <i>premium</i> spring water. The bottle itself closely resembles a
wine bottle, which makes it all the more ridiculous.  My friend and I thought it was hilarious, so we both each bought
a 750 ml (25.4 oz) bottle for kicks.  When we got to his car, we both opened our bottles and took a swig. Here's a pic:<BR><BR>

<img src="../photos/misc/flo.jpg" class="border">
<p align="center"><i>It's right next to my bed so I can take a swig first thing in the morning and right before I sleep!</i></p>

<BR><b>Conclusion:</b><BR><BR>

After a couple of gulps, I have to say that <i>it tastes like water</i>. In fact, it tastes quite bland.
It's got nothing on other generic brands of purified water enhanced with minerals for taste, because they actually
have a distinct, delicious taste. Also, the product itself costs $2.69, which is fairly expensive for water and
about two dollars too much.  I bet the glass bottle costs more than the water itself. When you get right down to it,
this is obviously just a novelty item, and you shouldn't buy this more than once unless you have more money
than you know what to do with. Actually, if you have more money than you know what to do with, send it to over
me to help me pay for my college education.<BR><BR>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td width="60"><b>Product:</b></td><td><i>First Liquid Obsession</i>, 750 ml (25.4 oz) bottle</td></tr>

<h3>Absolutely Ridiculous</h3>

Of all the ridiculous things I've read about,
<a href="http://www.1pstart.com/student-arrested-for-suspected-terrorist-activity/" target="_blank">this article</a>
takes the cake.<BR><BR>

When I was in middle school, I actually wanted to make a 3-d map
of my school, but I lacked the ability to do so (and still do). I thought it would be neat to recreate my school by memory
and shoot bad guys there in a video game. The thought of shooting up the place in real life never even
crossed my mind; in fact I was completely disgusted by the idea. Granted, I didn't love my middle school or the immature assholes
whom I had to call my classmates, but making a map of a place for fun is completely different than going on a killing spree there in real life. 
I don't know about other people, but I have the ability to differentiate between reality and fantasy.
Yes, I was able to do this even when I was only thirteen... oh, please.<BR><BR><BR>

On another note, <a href="http://remix.thasauce.net/" target="_blank">Remix:ThaSauce</a> is a video game remix community
that's a lot like <a href="http://www.ocremix.org" target="_blank">OCRemix</a>, except their standards aren't as super high.
I submitted my Chrono Trigger <a href="music/remixes/AzureKevin - Reawakening.mp3">Reawakening</a> arrangement to them a
few weeks ago, and they've accepted it! A link will show up on the front page sooner than later, complete with a short review.

<h3>Guestbook</h3>

The only reason I bother to keep this site running is because people such as yourself actually
care to visit it. My guestbook has been rather well hidden on my website, so I thought I'd make it more accessable.
If you guys don't mind, it'd be neat if you took the time to <a href="http://books.dreambook.com/gohan1/website.sign.html">sign</a>

<h3>April Fool's</h3>

April Fool's, now here's a fine tradition that other traditions can really learn from. Sure, the premise might
be stupid, but at least on this one day, we can learn not to take everything so seriously and have a little
fun for a change. You can be as silly as you want with your jokes, and no one should really judge you;
if they do, they're lame and probably have no sense of humor. It's kind of like drinking, except without
desecration of the liver (unless you pull a really nasty practical joke, which I do not recommended because that
would just be cruel).<BR><BR>

Now if we could only come up with a new tradition that pushed for compassion, respect, and gratefulness, and had
it take place every single day, we'd be set as a society.<BR><BR>

Unfortunately, Google is not actually giving away <a href="http://www.google.com/tisp/" target="_blank">free broadband</a>.

<h3>It's Already March...</h3>

I have the coolest SAGES professor ever. We had two papers due today, but I didn't really have time to
start them until last night. After spending hours on one paper, I realized there was no way I would be able
to write a second paper without staying up really late and half-assing it. So I sent my professor an e-mail
and stated that I had been busy for the past two weeks and asked if I could have an extension. It was
extremely short notice, so I did not expect to have my wish granted. She responded this morning with
an e-mail that said, "Certainly, you may have an extension." No hesistation. Pure awesome.

I've come to the conclusion that I cannot do homework in my dorm room no matter how hard I try. It's
mentally impossible; there are too many distractions, my computer being the main one. With that I've
decided to officially make my room a no-homework zone (reading is an allowable exception). To accomplish
that, I've rearranged my computer so that it pretty much takes up my entire desk. Now it's both mentally
<i>and physically</i> impossible. Besides, the study rooms in Fribley are much better environments in
which to learn. There are no beds, computers, or anything else that might be a potential distraction...
except the lights, maybe? I'm not that ADD.<BR><BR>

I've also decided that engineering homework, especially Dynamics, is nearly impossible
to do without friends. The homework problems in our textbook must have been written by physics obsessors.
You know a problem is unfair when even the TA isn't sure how to solve it. But that's cool because I prefer
problem solving over memorizing slides.<BR><BR>

when I was playing around with my MIDI keyboard. The song itself uses the <i>actual</i> music box instrument from Chrono Trigger!

<h3>Windows Vista</h3>

So today is the official launch of this new operating system from Microsoft. I've been running
the Business edition of Vista for about a week now, and I figured I'd share my personal opinion and
wisdom (in case anyone actually reads this).<BR><BR>

<b>Pros</b>: The new Aero GUI looks nice and is fast and responsive. It's quite stable; when programs do crash,
your computer isn't bogged down. Backwards compatibility with older software is good. Direct X 10 will come in handy when games such as 
<a href="http://www.alanwake.com" target="_blank">Alan Wake</a> and <a href="http://www.incrysis.com/" target="_blank">Crysis</a>
are released.<BR><BR>

<b>Cons</b>: Driver support sucks right now, and you might need to upgrade hardware in order to run Vista. Also, some
programs and games run slower on Vista than on XP. It's too expensive.<BR><BR>

Basically, if you're thinking about rushing out and buying a copy of Windows Vista right now, <i>don't</i>,
especially if you're just a casual computer user. You won't notice much of a difference other than the
new interface. Since Vista drivers are lacking at the moment, some of your hardware might not function.
A few months down the road, Vista might be worth getting, if not for Direct X 10 games alone,
but right now it's too expensive to be justified. If, on the other hand, you can obtain a free or cheap copy
through your university, like I did, then it's definitely worth it. Just make sure you know what you're doing and that
your computer is up to snuff. I'd run <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/buyorupgrade/upgradeadvisor.mspx"
target="_blank">Windows Upgrade Advisor</a> first.

<h3>Course Override Request</h3>

I emailed the professor of a course I wanted to get into with the hope of obtaining an override:<BR>

<blockquote><i>

Hello Professor Drake,<BR><BR>

I've decided to change majors very recently, and thus would like to
change courses.  I want to take EMAE 172 this semester, but all of the
labs are full.  Is it possible to get an override for the 19886 course?
I'd appreciate it greatly.<br><br>

Sincerely,<BR>
Kevin Che

</i></blockquote><BR>

This was his amazing reply:<BR>


<blockquote><i>

No overrides allowed.<BR>
Jim Drake
